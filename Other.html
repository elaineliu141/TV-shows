				<p class= "title">People in the US watch TV for the same reason everybody else watches TV:  It's fun, not exhausting, but sufficiently distracting to take us away from the drudgery and stress of our lives.  Today is the GOLDEN AGE of TV.  Never has there been so many amazing things to watch and with such variety. Here are some other good shows to watch! P.S. Only watch these shows after you finish Game of Thrones! </p>
