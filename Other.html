				<p class= "title">People in the US watch TV for the same reason everybody else watches TV:  It's fun, not exhausting, but sufficiently distracting to take us away from the drudgery and stress of our lives.  Today is the GOLDEN AGE of TV.  Never has there been so many amazing things to watch and with such variety. Here are some other good shows to watch! P.S. Only watch these shows after you finish Game of Thrones! </p>

				<p >Too much anime you say?! There is never too much anime.</p>

				<p>That is what the delusionals and the self-denials and the non-believers would say. But you – you are a self-respecting person who just happens to love this certain fascinating culture and you are just very knowledgeable in it, and the only flaw you consider yourself to have is that you don’t like going outdoors because you might get a tan or you just can’t stand being around people who don’t share your views and interest in anime… right?</p>

				<p>Don’t worry. We are here to help you identify if you have a problem. (Like watching too much anime should be a problem. Pfft. Society.)</p>
