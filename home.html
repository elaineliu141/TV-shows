				<h2 class = "Binge">Why I Binge Watch TV Shows</h2>
				<p>You do it, I do it: We all occasionally binge on Netflix. In fact, Netflix accounts for 35 percent of Internet bandwidth during peak hours. (That certainly doesn't surprise me, given that Netflix causes 35 percent of my evening emotions.) Binge-watching is usually defined as viewing 2-3 episodes in a single sitting, but if you’re anything like me, you’re one of the people who’s gotten the “Are you still alive?” alert after hours of an epic TV marathon.</p>

				<h3 class = "title">Addiction Is About the Anticipation, Not the Reward</h3>
				<p>Think about your favorite TV show: What are the moments where you feel the biggest high? Usually they’re the ones right before something happens that makes you hide your head in your sweatshirt or right before that big kiss. That’s because in our brains, the biggest bursts of that tasty little neurotransmitter known as dopamine occur before the reward. And this, of course, fuels us to keep watching. </p>

				<h3 class = "title">It Takes More and More TV to Keep You Happy</h3>
				<p>When some people finish a great movie or an episode on Netflix, their dopamine levels drop back to normal. But for others, the reserves in their brain have lost count and dip just a tiny bit below normal. It’s what I like to call Post Series Finale Depression (PSFD). So what do you do? You watch even more episodes in a single sitting.

				This happened when I started marathoning Breaking Bad on Netflix. At first, I found that I could only watch around three episodes at a time. “Too much manpain all at once,” I explained to a friend. But as my tolerance for dude crises increased, so did my ability to watch six or seven episodes at a time. Some might blame laziness to stop the autoplay feature, but it’s actually brain chemistry at work.</p>
